1. HTML and CSS: Both "index.html" and "portfolio.html" will share the same CSS files ("styles.css" and "tailwind.css") for styling and layout purposes. 

2. Tailwind CSS: This is a utility-first CSS framework that is used in both HTML files for styling. It is included in the "tailwind.css" file.

3. Image Files: The image files ("images/sample1.jpg", "images/sample2.jpg", "images/sample3.jpg", "images/sample4.jpg", "images/sample5.jpg") are shared between the "index.html" and "portfolio.html" files. They are used to display the photographer's work on the portfolio page.

4. DOM Elements: The id names of DOM elements that are shared between the HTML files could include "header", "footer", "main", "portfolio", and "imageGallery". These ids are used to target specific sections of the website for styling and interactivity.

5. CSS Classes: Shared CSS classes between the HTML files could include "container", "grid", "card", and "image". These classes are used to apply consistent styling across different elements and sections of the website.

6. Function Names: If any JavaScript is used, shared function names could include "toggleMenu", "loadImages", "filterImages", etc. These functions would be used to add interactivity to the website, such as opening and closing a mobile navigation menu, loading the images on the portfolio page, and filtering images based on categories.
